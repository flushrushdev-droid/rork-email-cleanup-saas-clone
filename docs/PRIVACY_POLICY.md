## Introduction

AthenX Mail ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and services.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Email Address**: We collect your email address when you connect your Gmail account through Google OAuth authentication.
- **User Preferences**: We store your app preferences such as theme settings (light/dark mode) and notification preferences locally on your device.

### Information Automatically Collected
- **Email Content**: We temporarily access and display your email messages, subject lines, senders, and metadata through the Gmail API to provide email management functionality.
- **OAuth Tokens**: We securely store authentication tokens provided by Google OAuth to maintain your session and access Gmail on your behalf.

### Information from Third Parties
- **Google Account Information**: When you authenticate with Google, we receive basic profile information (name, email, profile picture) that you have authorized us to access.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Improve User Experience**: Store your preferences to personalize the app experience.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- **Secure Storage**: OAuth tokens and authentication credentials are stored securely using device-level encryption (SecureStore) and are never stored in plain text.
- **User Preferences**: Non-sensitive preferences are stored locally on your device using standard storage mechanisms.

### Data Transmission
- **Encryption**: All data transmitted between the app and our servers or Google APIs is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols.

### Data Retention
- **Active Sessions**: Authentication tokens are retained only while you are actively using the app and are automatically removed when you sign out.
- **Local Preferences**: Your app preferences are stored locally on your device until you uninstall the app or clear app data.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### Third-Party Services
- **Google APIs**: We share necessary information with Google APIs (Gmail API) to provide email management functionality. This sharing is governed by Google's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
- **No Sale of Data**: We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.
